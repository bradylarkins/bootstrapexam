          <p><i>American Online (AOL)<i> was the beginning of the modern age of email. Beginning in 1983, AOL was nothing more than a gaming hub for Atari before being transformed by several key acquisitions. After being launched with Windows in 1991, <i>AOL<i> introduced Dungeons & Dragons’ <i>” Neverwinter Nights”<i>. This, being one of the first Online Multiplayer Games, increased online traffic exponentially. In exchange for access to Windows, <i>AOL<i> begun the use of Internet Explorer. This development coincided with the launch of services like: National Geographic, the Smithsonian Institute, the Library of Congress, CNN, and the Teachers’ Information Network. Perhaps their most famous service was their Electronic Mail Service. Which was widely accepted as the forefather of internet connection at that time. It is still in use today although its subscription use is widely controversial. Despite its flaws, the company is still valued at 4.4 billion USD and remains in widespread use to this day. It has been owned by many companies such as Time Warner and Verizon. It may have become less relevant in modern times, however, with its popularity spiking with the rise of the internet, it is impossible to ignore as the foundation of modern internet. </p>
